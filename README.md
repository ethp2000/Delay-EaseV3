## Delay-EaseV3

Delay-Ease takes a UK train ticket screenshot, checks if youâ€™re eligible for Delay Repay, and, if eligible, can auto-fill and submit a claim for supported operators.

## Overview
Delay-EaseV3 streamlines the delay repay process by extracting ticket information from images, checking for delays using real-time data, and (when 
eligible) automating claim submissions through train operator websites. The system supports Type A train operating companies including CrossCountry, 
Transport for Wales, TransPennine Express, Great Western Railway, Northern, and South Western Railway.
